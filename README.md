# Phonebook web app

Uses the frontend made in part 2 found here: https://github.com/hagantsa/fullstack-open-exercises/tree/main/part2/phonebook

This repo contains just the production build of the frontend. In this repo there are also configuration files for fly.io. Note that the backend uses the port 8080 as apparently required by fly.io.

The url to the app deployed to fly.io is here:
